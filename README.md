# Arduino-Project
The apparatus was developed by ‘Arduino IDE’ which is a computer program using the instruments from Arduino including Arduino Uno (Main board), Ultrasonic distance sensor, GY-31 color sensor, N20 gear motor and buzzer speaker. Each part of functions was separated in different files for easier experiments and testing before each part is put together as a workpiece mechanism together with the assembly or model, it can be used for further evaluation.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92824339/209465189-9ae6110c-9198-45dd-bb91-883aceaf522c.png)
